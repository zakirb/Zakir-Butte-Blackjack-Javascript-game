Blackjack

For my project, I decided to build a simple blackjack game using HTML and CSS/Bootstrap for the basic layout and relying on JavaScript and the JQuery library in order to manipulate the DOM and introduce card image elements onto the playing screen. 

In order to implement a 6-deck blackjack game, I decided to use DeckOfCardsAPI.com, which provided me with a JSON object consisting of 6 decks of cards and data such as card value (Ace through King) and even card image URLs, which I manipulated in order to calculate and sum the values of our player or dealer's active cards, and display the correct image for each card.
